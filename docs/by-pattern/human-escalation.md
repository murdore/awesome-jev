# Human escalation

<sub>[awesome-jev](../../README.md) · [中文](human-escalation.zh-CN.md)</sub>

_Use calibrated confidence to decide what a person must see._

Every catalogued example of this decision — 67 of them, official first, then rows with code, then by stars. The same rows, with caveats, are in [the index](../../README.md#human-escalation); [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?p=human-escalation&lang=en) can filter them further by language, primitive and kind.
