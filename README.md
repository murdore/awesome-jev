## What this is

- **Jev** is a decision model from TypeSafe AI. It does not write text — you hand it state plus typed questions and it returns typed answers with calibrated confidence, fast and cheap enough to sit in an agent's inner loop.
- **This repo** indexes public examples of using it, organised by the *decision* being made. The resource you read this week is disposable; the decision pattern is not.
- **How to assess it:** every row names its source. Call-site citations, primitive claims and caveats are recorded where available, so you can inspect what was read and what remains untested.

> [!NOTE]
> Not the product, not an SDK, not affiliated with TypeSafe AI, and not a recommendation. Inclusion is a source record, not a runtime or performance endorsement. See [what is verified](#what-is-verified-and-what-is-not).

## What Jev returns

Three primitives. Every pattern below is built out of them, and the asymmetry in the last row is the single most common source of bugs.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/primitives-en-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/primitives-en-light.svg" alt="Three panels describing the choice, score and noul primitives and what each returns" width="660">
</picture>

Input is **text only** — string, JSON object, or array of text. Context is **64k** tokens per request, **32k** for the state plus the longest question. Output tokens are free. There are no published weights, so it cannot be run locally. Full cross-platform differences: [`docs/compatibility.md`](docs/compatibility.md).

## Start here

Six things in reading order. Hand-picked, because "most starred" is not the same as "read this first".

1. **[Quickstart](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction/quickstart)**

   The canonical first call: one support ticket, one Choice, one Score and one Noul in a single request, in Python, JS and cURL.

2. **[Jev 1.13 known limitations](https://docs.typesafe.ai/model-jaggedness/jev-1.13)**

   The most useful page in the docs and the least linked. It explains, among other things, that a Choice over options and one Noul per option answer different questions.

3. **[Example: three primitives in one request](https://github.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/blob/main/examples/01-three-primitives/main.py)**

   Written from the official API reference and checked field by field against it, but not executed against the live API.

4. **[fast-jev-compaction](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction)**

   Exactly two nouls per tool call: does knowing this call happened still matter, and is the full output still needed verbatim. Despite the word "scored" in its own description, no score primitive is used.

5. **[ai-cookbook: Jev track](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook)**

   The best structured tutorial found. It states plainly that typed output does not guarantee a correct decision, lists the documented weaknesses, and qualifies its own cost illustration rather than selling it.

6. **[Hermes Agent: Jev compaction evaluation](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)**

   The single most credible row in this catalog. Recall came out below their existing summariser, and at a matched context budget it tied plain recency ordering. Cost was genuinely far lower. Publishing a negative result on a hyped model is rare.

## Coverage

Every decision pattern, sized by how many entries this catalogue contains. Use the pattern index below the chart to jump to a section. A zero is a research gap, not a rendering bug.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/coverage-en-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/coverage-en-light.svg" alt="Horizontal bar chart of how many catalog examples exist for each of the eighteen decision patterns" width="100%">
</picture>

All 18 patterns have at least one catalogue entry. Coverage does not imply runtime testing or equal maturity. See [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md).

## Measured, not claimed

Independent measurement reports in the catalogue, including **negative results** that help explain where an approach fails. These are the original authors' measurements; this repository has not independently reproduced them. Check each report's dataset, method and model version before comparing results.

- **[Hermes Agent: Jev compaction evaluation](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)**<br>
  Ported the Jev compaction approach, measured it against their shipping summariser, and published the conclusion not to adopt it.<br>
  <sub>`Benchmark` · ★250,216 · `Py` · `noul`</sub>

  > The single most credible row in this catalog. Recall came out below their existing summariser, and at a matched context budget it tied plain recency ordering. Cost was genuinely far lower. Publishing a negative result on a hyped model is rare.

- **[worldmonitor: news threat classification](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor)**<br>
  Two Choice questions over threat level and category, held in shadow mode after a blind evaluation found Jev merely tied the incumbent model.<br>
  <sub>`Benchmark` · ★87,614 · `TS` · `choice`</sub>

  **Caveats:** `shadow mode`

  > Wired in but deliberately inert: by their own statement nothing Jev returns reaches a label, a cache row or an alert. Ships a golden fixture. A model to copy for how to trial a new model without betting production on it.

- **[no-mistakes: Jev review pre-brief, measured and retired](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes/pull/1165)**<br>
  One Score per candidate file to pre-brief code review — measured twice, then removed: more billed input for essentially no wall-clock gain, and offline replay showed the candidate list could not reach where review findings land.<br>
  <sub>`Benchmark` · ★8,694 · `Go` · `score`</sub>

  > Removed in PR #1165 (2026-09-22). Their offline measurement found the candidate generator excluded changed files by construction while nearly all review findings sit in changed files, and that per-file excerpts made the list less precise at higher token cost. The code is gone from the default branch, so this row cites the change that removed it.

- **[hippo-memory](https://github.com/kitfunso/hippo-memory)**<br>
  Biologically-inspired memory for AI agents. Decay, retrieval strengthening, consolidation. Zero runtime deps, SQLite, MCP. Benchmarked retrieval with an opt-in TypeSafe Jev reranker.<br>
  <sub>`Benchmark` · ★766 · kitfunso · `TS`</sub>

- **[Probing Jev's behaviour with repeated API calls](https://github.com/ahastudio/til)**<br>
  Independent Korean-language notes reporting that reversing the order of options shifted a probability enough to flip a 0.9 threshold.<br>
  <sub>`Benchmark` · ★191 · `Py`</sub>

  **Caveats:** `no licence` · `unverified claims`

  > The most actionable engineering caveat found anywhere: if option order alone can move a probability past your threshold, your threshold is not as stable as it looks. Independent and unreplicated, so treat the magnitude as indicative.

</details>

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`docs/patterns.md`](docs/patterns.md) | Every pattern defined, each with an explicit *when NOT to use this*. |
| [`docs/compatibility.md`](docs/compatibility.md) | Model string, field names, request shape, endpoint and env var differ per platform. This is that table. |
| [`docs/vetting.md`](docs/vetting.md) | What to check before trusting a row, and the one mistake most people make. |
| [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md) | What week one of this ecosystem actually looked like, gaps included. |
| [`docs/method.md`](docs/method.md) | How the catalog was built, what was excluded, and where it is weakest. |
| [`docs/sources.md`](docs/sources.md) | Where every row came from, and the licence position. |
| [`examples/`](examples/) | Four runnable examples. One deliberately leaves the threshold policy to you. |
| [`schema/entry.schema.json`](schema/entry.schema.json) | What a catalog entry may contain. |
| [`.claude-plugin/`](.claude-plugin/) | Install the skill and the MCP server together in Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add kydlikebtc/awesome-jev`, then `/plugin install awesome-jev@awesome-jev`. |
| [`src/awesome_jev_mcp/`](src/awesome_jev_mcp/) | An MCP server, so an agent can query the catalogue instead of reading it. Caveats travel with every result, and so does how current the data is. |
| [`skills/awesome-jev/`](skills/awesome-jev/) | An agent skill: the facts that generated Jev code most often gets wrong, and the design rules worth following. |
| [`scripts/verify_claims.py`](scripts/verify_claims.py) | Re-reads every cited call site weekly, so a primitive claim is checkable rather than asserted. |
| [`scripts/refresh_metadata.py`](scripts/refresh_metadata.py) | Re-reads stars, licences and archive status from the GitHub API and opens a PR. |

## What is verified, and what is not

- **Link checks** — 1204 rows carry an HTTP 2xx response and a `checked` date; 3 carry no dated success record. Dates vary by row and a past success does not guarantee availability today. Stars and licences are repository metadata snapshots.

- **Source and code review** — `evidence.path` cites the file read, `evidence.read_on` records the reported review date, and `evidence_none` explains missing file evidence. Reading a call site is separate from running it. Summaries include source descriptions and machine translations; see the [method and its limits](docs/method.md).

- **Call-site text checks** — 1121 rows record a file and matching strings in `evidence`. The weekly [claims job](https://github.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/actions/workflows/claims.yml) checks that those strings remain on the default branch and reports missing text or files. This count measures recorded evidence, **not latest CI passes**. A text match does not prove that a call executes, the API is compatible, or the result is correct.

- **Runtime and performance not independently tested here** — treat every catalogue entry as untested by this repository, including entries without `code-untested`. Linked benchmarks describe their authors' measurements; this catalogue has not reproduced them. Repository build checks and package smoke tests do not exercise those integrations or the live Jev API, and inclusion is not a security review.


### What the tags mean

| Tag | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `not Jev itself` | Does not call Jev at all. A compatible API does not imply compatible calibration, so thresholds do not transfer. |
| `shadow mode` | Wired in but deliberately inert — nothing it returns reaches a user-visible decision. |
| `early access` | Needs waitlist access to run. |
| `code untested` | The code was read, not executed. |
| `one commit` | One commit, so maintenance is unlikely. |
| `no licence` | No LICENSE file, whatever a README badge claims. A blocker for reuse. |
| `3rd-party key` | Needs a key for a service other than TypeSafe. |
| `vendor numbers` | Repeats the vendor's own benchmarks rather than an independent measurement. |
| `unverified claims` | Makes measurement claims that could not be checked. |
| `AI-written` | Reads as machine-generated content. |
| `marketing` | Published to sell something as much as to explain. |
| `paywall` | Behind a paywall or a metered reader. |
| `archived` | Development has visibly stopped. |

### Retired links

Links that stopped resolving, kept so a dead reference stays searchable instead of vanishing.

| Example | Why |
| --- | --- |
| jev-atlas | Retired 2026-09-24: the repository returns 404 on both the API and the web while its owner's account still exists — deleted or made private. Kept here so the reference stays searchable. `HTTP 404` |
| jev-mac-voice | Retired 2026-09-24: the repository returns 404 on both the API and the web while its owner's account still exists — deleted or made private. Kept here so the reference stays searchable. `HTTP 404` |

## Machine-readable data

One entry per example, validated against a JSON Schema on every push.

| [`retired.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/main/retired.json) | 2 retired |
| [`compat.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/main/compat.json) | The platform matrix behind `docs/compatibility.md` |
| [`patterns.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/main/patterns.json) | The decision taxonomy both generators and the MCP server read |
| [`collections.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/main/collections.json) | Bilingual editorial paths, selection reasons and limitations |
| [`schema/entry.schema.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/main/schema/entry.schema.json) | One entry's shape |
| [`llms.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/main/llms.txt) | For agents, with the caveats spelled out |

## Contributing and licence

Corrections take priority over additions — a wrong row costs more than a missing one. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); the bar is *could a reader act on this row without opening the link?*

Code in `scripts/`, `site/` and `examples/` is [MIT](LICENSE-MIT). Catalog metadata is [CC0-1.0](LICENSE-CC0), with a per-row `license` field. Linked works keep their own licences — `repo_license` records what each declares.

**Maintenance checks:** [![lint](https://github.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/actions/workflows/lint.yml) · [Scheduled link checks](https://github.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/actions/workflows/links.yml) · [Call-site text checks](https://github.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/actions/workflows/claims.yml)
